Objective
==========

• Use the wordnik api to pick a random word (play around with the api params to get reasonable words)
• Scramble it and show the scrambled word to the user
• Take in keyboard input to type out the unscrambled word (you shouldn't have to use the mouse at all)
• Spend some time on the design and usability (CSS transitions are awesome)
• Try to keep the code simple and clean
• Supports anagrams (if the "correct" word is "evil" then it should also accept "live" as correct)
